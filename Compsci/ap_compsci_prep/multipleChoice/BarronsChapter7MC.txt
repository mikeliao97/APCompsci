1. D . Tail recursion is putting off the work until the very end
2. D. sum(n)+ sum(n-1) does not equal to summ.
3. E this won't end
4. D This will work
5. B.  Basically 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 *2
6. B this is the previosu questions logic
7. B This method returns 2 * n and one k
8. D The method returns 2, its a lil bit smaller than it seems
9. A What...this is confusing. So t is equal to the previous call
of recur(x, n-1). So if (x[n-1]) > t . Okay so at the very end of the call
it will return x[0] or t. Basically it compares wether t is bigger or x[n] is 
bigger. Eventually when recursion is finished it finds the largest value.
10.B I think it prints this in reverse order. 
11.A  Definately A. This is when the exponent is negative
12.C Just regular old recursion
13.C Only 3. the other ones have if statements that exclude some number
14.A  Outputs 12
15.E Outputs - 4
16.D It makes 15 calls
17.E It returns 15
18.C  wat...
19.B It is out of range 
20.B 
21.B
